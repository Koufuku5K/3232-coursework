# 3232-coursework
A small game for 3232 coursework created by William Moses (Student ID: 200507666).

Disclaimer:

Not all assets used in this game are created by me. Furthermore, there are some C# scripts that I did not write myself. Some are
from GitHub and some are from the lectures (Prof. Giacomo's AI Codebase). Below is where I reference all of the assets and C# scripts
that I did not create myself.
